This repository contains the source code for Cryptocomms, a simple system for reliable
encrypted communication written in C++. Cryptocomms is in the process of being developed
by me, Reuben Green, as a vehicle for demonstrating my ability in C++ and software
development. Cryptocomms is intended exclusively for this purpose, and is **NOT** intended
to be used to protect real communications, see WARNING below.

I am still in the process of developing a first full version of Cryptocomms. Currently
(13 November 2025) Cryptocomms can move data between hosts with authenticated encryption,
but does not yet have reliability. I have posted this unfinished version to GitHub so that
people can see an example of my work
