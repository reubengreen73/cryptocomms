# Introduction #

This file is the current work-in-progress version of the user manual for Cryptocomms. Some
of the text below describes features yet to be implemented. I have added notes in square
brackets to clarify which features have and have not been implemented, as well as places
where this manual is not yet complete, with the format [NOTE: note text goes here].

Cryptocomms is a simple system for reliable encrypted communication written in
C++. Cryptocomms is in the process of being developed by me, Reuben Green, as a vehicle
for demonstrating my ability in C++ and software development. Cryptocomms is intended
exclusively for this purpose, and is NOT intended to be used to protect real
communications, see the file WARNING_README.

I am still in the process of developing a first full version of Cryptocomms. Currently (13
November 2025) Cryptocomms can move data between hosts with authenticated encryption, but
does not yet have reliability.


############
# Overview #
############

[NOTE: Cryptocomms can currently move data between hosts with authenticated encryption,
but does so without the reliability described in this section.]

Cryptocomms is a simple system for reliable encrypted communication written in C++.

Cryptocomms allows two or more devices to communicate securely using a simple system of
encryption and authentication. A device using Cryptocomms for communication is called a
"host" in this documentation.

To use Cryptocomms on a device, a user must create a configuration file which includes
details of all other Cryptocomms hosts which the device may communicate with. When
Cryptocomms starts, it reads this configuration file and, for each remote host, creates
one or more pairs of FIFOs in the local file system to allow communication with the remote
host. Each pair of FIFOs provides a separate "channel" of communication with the remote
host and corresponds to a matching pair of FIFOs on the remote host. Each FIFO pair has an
"outbound" and an "inbound" FIFO, and the essential functionality of Cryptocomms is that
anything written to the "outbound" FIFO on one host appears on the "inbound" FIFO on the
other host.

Cryptocomms should work on any POSIX-conforming system, but it has so far been developed
and tested only on Debian Linux.


########################
# Building Cryptocomms #
########################

Building Cryptocomms requires the GNU C++ compiler and associated toolchain and libraries,
Python3, and make (any version of make should work, but only GNU make has been tested).

Building Cryptocomms is a two-stage process. First, generate the Makefile by running the
Python script gen_makefile.py. Then build the code by running one of "make all", "make
cryptocomms" or "make tester". These three make targets work as follows: the "cryptocomms"
target builds the main cryptocomms binary, the "tester" target builds the test binary (see
below), and "all" does both. There is also a "make clean" target which removes all
generated files except the Makefile itself.

To check that everything is working correctly, you can build and run the "tester" binary.
To do a full test, just run this binary with no arguments (see the developer manual for
more details on running the test binary). This may take some time to run, and will print
"ALL TESTS PASSED" in the event of success.

By default, all binaries are built with debugging symbols. To disable this, you can add
DBG="" to the make arguments, e.g.  make DBG="" all

The only build product needed to run Cryptocomms is the cryptocomms binary file, which can
be used in place or moved to another location.


###########################
# Configuring Cryptocomms #
###########################

Cryptocomms is controlled via a configuration file. The path to this file needs to be
supplied as the sole argument of the cryptocomms binary. The configuration file contains
configuration for the host itself, as well as details of all remote hosts it can
communicate with. Here is a simple example of a configuration file (the file text is
everything between, but not including, the two "---EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE---" lines).

---EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE---
# config for this host
name: self
id: 70F03a83
ip: 192.168.3.55
port: 1003

# config for "other_host"
name: other_host
id: 01a7B0f9
ip: 192.168.17.19
key: 0123456789abcdefABCDEF023FaF0f9D098a701246a763a54b537DD75C656018
port: 2301
channel: 23ab /tmp/cryptocomms/sockets/other_host
max_size: 1000
---EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE---

[NOTE: the description of the config file format here is not complete yet]

The functional content of the config file consists of config lines, which have the format
<option-name>:<option-value>

Blank lines and comment lines are ignored. A "blank line" is one that is empty or contains
only whitespace, while a " comment line" is a line whose first non-whitespace character is
"#". Whitespace at the beginning or end of a config line is ignored, so you can indent
lines however you like.

Config lines are grouped into "stanzas", with each stanza describing one host.  A stanza
starts with a config line with option-name "name", and ends at the start of the next
stanza or the end of the file. The option-name "name" defines the name of the host. The
name "self" is special, and marks the stanza with the config for the local host. A stanza
for "self" is required.

Before describing the options, note that several option values are byte strings given as
hexadecimal strings. An byte string of length n is represented as a string of 2n
hexadecimal characters in the usual way (with both uppercase and lowercase letters
accepted).

Each host is identified by a string of 4 bytes, which is given as the value of
"id". Further, each stanza must list an ip address and port number. For "self" this is the
ip and port on which to listen for traffic, while for remote hosts it is the place to send
data packets.

The "self" stanza requires, besides the "name" line, lines for "id", "ip", and
"port". Other stanzas require these lines, as well as a "key" line, which gives a 32 byte
secret key for communicating with that host, and one or more "channel" lines which define
communication channels with that host.

Each channel line has the format
channel: <channel-id> <fifo-path>
where <channel-id> is a two byte value identifying the channel (this must be the same for
both hosts) and <fifo-path> is a file system path indicating where to find or create the
FIFOs for this channel.

The "self" stanza may include a line to set the "segment_number_file" option. This sets
the location and base name for the files where cryptocomms keeps a record of an internal
"segment number counter" which is needed for cryptographic security. If this value is not
set, default file names in the directory where cryptocomms is run will be used.  [NOTE:
need more on how to handle this properly]


#######################
# Running Cryptocomms #
#######################

To run Cryptocomms, you need to prepare a configuration file as described above. You also
need to create files to hold the stored record of the "segment number counter", and put a
valid segment number in them. The format of the configuration file is explained above, so
we shall now explain the format of the segment number files.

The path and base name of the segment number files are given by the "segment_number_file"
option in the configuration file. If this option is not set, the path defaults to the
current directory where Cryptocomms is running, and the base name defaults to
"segnumfile".  The actual names of the two files are created by suffixing "_FIRST" and
"_SECOND" to the base name. Before running Cryptocomms for the first time, you should
create these files. Their contents should be identical, consisting of two lines, each with
the single character "1" on it. After Cryptocomms has been run once, you should not modify
these files. If you need to move the files, ensure that you do not modify them and that
the configuration file is set up to point to the files' new path and base name (you must
preserve the "_FIRST" and "_SECOND" suffixes on the filenames).

To run Cryptocomms, run the cryptocomms binary with the path to the file as the only
argument. Cryptocomms will create the FIFOs for all channels if they do not exist.
Cryptocomms will then go into its main mode of operation, where it listens for data on a
FIFO or from the network, and moves that data as appropriate.

Other applications can use Cryptocomms to communicate as follows. Suppose that two hosts,
A and B, both have Cryptocomms running, and are configured to communicate via a
channel. There will be two FIFOs for the channel on each host, one for sending, whose name
will have the suffix "_OUTWARD", and one for receiving, whose name will have the suffix
"_INWARD". Let us suppose that the two FIFOS on A are "B_connection_OUTWARD" and
"B_connection_INWARD", while the FIFOS on B are "A_connection_OUTWARD" and
"A_connection_INWARD". Let us further suppose that there is a process Proc_A running on A
and a process Proc_B running on B which need to communicate. Proc_A can open the FIFO
B_connection_OUTWARD for writing, and Proc_B can open the FIFO A_connection_INWARD for
reading. Anything written by Proc_A into its FIFO will then appear for reading at Proc_B's
FIFO.
