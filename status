[This file holds notes on the current status of cryptocomms while it is under construction]


I have now created the build system and test framework. I have some bits of code for cryptocomms
which I have already created, and my next task is to incorporate them here.

The high-level structure of cryptocomms will be as follows. The top-level class is Session, which
represents a session of cryptocomms. The Session will manage the other components, including a set
of Connection objects. The Connection class represents a single encrypted connection with another
cryptocomms instance, and manages all of the encryption and reliable delivery. The Session will
also manage a collection of threads, including a pool of worker threads which will service the
Connection objects.
