[This file holds notes on the current status of cryptocomms while it is under construction]

I have now filled in the functionality of Session and some of the functionality of Connection.
The system now transmits data correctly, but without reliability or encryption. The next step
is to add encryption and authentication to Connection (which will involve creating some new
units).

The high-level structure of cryptocomms will be as follows. The top-level class is Session, which
represents a session of cryptocomms. The Session will manage the other components, including a set
of Connection objects. The Connection class represents a single encrypted connection with another
cryptocomms instance, and manages all of the encryption and reliable delivery. The Session will
also manage a collection of threads, including a pool of worker threads which will service the
Connection objects.
