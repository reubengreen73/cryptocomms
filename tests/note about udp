Several of these tests involve sending and receiving UDP datagrams. These exchanges always happen
between sockets on localhost, but in theory UDP can still be unreliable in this setting.

Most systems will (I think) in practice always achieve reliable in-order delivery of UDP datagrams
between sockets on localhost, provided that the amount of data written does not overflow internal
buffers.

The tests here assume that the host provides reliable in-order delivery of UDP datagrams between
sockets on localhost, provided that only a small amount of data is written to the sending socket
at a time, and that this data is then read out of the receiving socket before any more data is sent.
Specifically, the "small amount" assumed is about 1500 bytes at a time.
